**Random Music Generation**

Collected data from a youtube video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG9sahHCD5M
Then convert it into mp3 format and download it using a converter: https://ytmp3.cc/en13/
Now we have a mp3 format audio data. So, using the python code which you get in triming of audio data we convert it into so many audio files each of length 30 sec.
Then with the help of audio to midi convertor convert those mp3 files into midi files and download it using the convertor: https://www.bearaudiotool.com/mp3-to-midi
